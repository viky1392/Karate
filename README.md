Karate Practice

Creating this repo for my practice of API Automation using Karate.

Immediate Goals : 

1) To implement a working framework in BDD style.
2) To implement Allure reporting with historical data tracking.
3) To implement Extent reporting and compare the pros and cons between the reports.
4) Connect to CICD : Jenkins or Codefresh and Trigger a build.

Note : This is a living document and will be updated from time to time.
